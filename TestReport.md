# Integration approach

    The original intention regarding the whole testing suite was using a bottom-up approach, so we started with the lowel level unit tests. We continued with testing just the unit tests also for the higher levels too though, routes included, meaning that we mocked the interactions with the lower levels.
    The integration tests have thus been performed only at the route level, meaning that it encompassed the scope of the API tests too.
    The order of implementation was: DAO Unit Tests -> Controller Unit Tests -> Route Unit Tests -> Route Integration/API Tests, that relied on a confident correct operation of the lower level modules.

    Integration (and API) testing focused mainly on the check of FRs and UCs. BB Partitioning (with focus on state and boundaries in some cases) and WB Coverage were not applied here, but were the main methods applied in Unit Testing, where statement and decision coverage Maximization has provided acceptable statistics, while BB partitioning was slightly limited, as the available time didn't allow for an exhaustive implementation.
